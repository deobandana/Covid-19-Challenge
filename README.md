### Topic:Covid-19-Project
 COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
 Because it is a new virus, scientists are learning more each day. 
 Although most people who have COVID-19 have mild symptoms, COVID-19 can also cause severe illness and even death.
 Some groups, including older adults and people who have certain underlying medical conditions, are at increased risk of severe illness.
