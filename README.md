 COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
 Because it is a new virus, scientists are learning more each day. 
 Although most people who have COVID-19 have mild symptoms, COVID-19 can also cause severe illness and even death.
 Some groups, including older adults and people who have certain underlying medical conditions, are at increased risk of severe illness.


 Story of its origin -
During November, 2019 - a severe viral infection was noticed in Wuhan, a city in Hubei provinces of China. On November 17th 2019, the first case this infection was reported. Doctor's initially took it lightly as if it was a normal fever/cold. But, when a wide range of patients reported similar symptoms, a doctor - Dr. Li Wenliang of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Lab, claimed that it was a type of severe acute respiratory syndrome, spreading through a new coronavirus transmission in the whole Hubei province, very rapidly. This news got exposed during the late December 2019. Unfortunatly, Dr. Li also died due to being affected by the same disease.

As per the sources, in 2003, the same lab found first deadly SARS Coronavirus, led to 813 casualties, all over the world, within two months!

Initially, it was named as "Wuhan Virus". But, as it started spreading rapidly from Hubei to the whole mainland of China, its name got replaced by term "China Virus".


Finally, on Feb. 11th 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) gave the disease an official name: COVID-19.
WHO has also declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic.


Since the outbreak of COVID-19, over 2,940,000 people have been infected throughout the world and over 203,822 people have been killed.

### About the Disease

The COVID-19 is spread as rapidly as it has the **Reproduction Number** (R-naught) **2.5**.

![R-naught](COVID-19/PLOTS/others/rnaught.png)

<br />

**Reproduction Number:** is meant for the average number of people, whom an infected person is further infecting. In more generalized language, on an average, from every COVID-19 patient, virus are getting transmitted to at least 2.5 fit persons.<br />
For Ebola, this number is appx. 1.7<br /><br />
In order to have controle on any epidemic, the reproducibility score has to be decreased as much as possible.<br /><br />
That's why, most of the highly countries are locked down. In many of them, there are the shortage of hospitals/beds/doctors, too.<br />
Due to the lockdown, the market is also going down.<br />


### Symptoms: 

The _severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19_ **(SARS-CoV-19)**, which is often termed as 2019-nCoV, as well, is basically a viral disease spread by the novel coronavirus in which the virus tend to attack onto the respiratory system of the patient.<br />

Though the studies are still going on, following are some most common symptoms of COVID-19, known so far:
> 1. Fever
> 2. Dry Cough
> 3. Fatigue
> 4. Shortness of Breath
> 5. Nasal Congestion etc..

These are the symptoms that are reported by most of the patients. Apart from these, few patients also found to develop aches and pains and get the sniffles, according to data from China.

## Questions: For Findings
1)Converting the data into list.
2)Finding the locations of China in dataframe?
3)Comparing the four different countries i.e US,Spain,Italy and Germany according to confirmed , recovery and deaths cases.
4)Comparing the cases of China along with confirmed,recovered and deaths cases because of it's origination.
5)Comparing China with four different countries of theirs recovery cases.
6)

1.) Study of Confirmed Case ,Death Case and Recovered Case for Moste Affected 5 Country 
2 ) Comparing Confirmed Case For each five Country and find Highest and lowest Among them 
2 ) Comparing Death Case For each five Country and find Highest and lowest Among them
2 ) Comparing Recovered  Case For each five Country and find Highest and lowest Among them
5.) Find Mote affected and least affected amomg these 5 countries.
